## Introducing `metapsyTools`

The `metapsyTools` package aims to facilitate the calculation of effect size data based on the  [Metapsy](https://evidencebasedpsychotherapies.shinyapps.io/metapsy/) database. Optimally, all included functions are used in combination. The three core functions in `metapsyTools` are intended to transform the imported data so that effect sizes can be calculated in R, for all trials and comparisons. 

Then, the calculated effect size data can be pooled to get one overall estimate of the effect size. For this step, any meta-analysis R package of your choice (e.g. `meta` or `metafor`) can be used.


## Characteristics of the Metapsy data format

When working with imported data of the Metapsy database in R, there are a few points to keep in mind:

* **The data is organized in a specific way**: study-specific data span multiple rows that can differ in their outcomes (e.g. primary or not), their conditions, arms and so on (similar to the _"longer" format_ in R). 

* However, in its original form, the data differs from the long format in one point that is needed for effect size calculation using R: In multiarm studies, **not all intervention groups have a clearly assignable control group**, which is required to calculate effect sizes using R.

We can see this, for example, in the study of Hauksson (2017): This is a three-arm study that compares two interventions ("grp" and "ind") against a control group (resulting in three rows for the primary outcome). In R, this format is too ambiguous to calculate effect sizes directly.

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=F}
# library(metapsyTools)
# library(dplyr)
# 
# inpatients %>% 
#   dplyr::filter(study=="Hauksson, 2017" & primary==1) %>% 
#   dplyr::select(c(1:6,8),) -> x
# 
# class(x) = "data.frame"
# x
```


## Workflow

It is important to keep this data structure in mind in order to understand the functioning of the `metapsyTools` package. The package provides tools to:

1. **check the data format** (`checkDataFormat`), 
2. **convert multiarm trials** to a format that allows effect size calculation for all comparisons (`expandMultiarmTrials`), and 
3. **calculate effect sizes** (i.e. Hedges' $g$), so that meta-analytic techniques can be applied (`calculateEffectSizes`).


### Introducing the "pipe"

For this purpose, it is highly recommended to combine all three functions using a **pipe** operator (`%>%`). This is a helpful tool which allows users to chain several R functions together.

Instead of nesting functions, a pipe processes an object using a sequence of operations by passing the result of one step as input for the next step. For the `metapsyTools` package, this means that each function can be applied on a meta-analysis data set in one run, and we do not have to create intermediate objects, or go through the process step by step, to get the required effect size data:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# inpatients %>% 
#   checkDataFormat() %>% 
#   expandMultiarmTrials() %>% 
#   calculateEffectSizes()
```

This code uses the `inpatients` example data set. First, the data set is checked, then the multiarm study rows are expanded, and finally, the effect sizes are calculated for each comparison. 

**_NOTE:_** The use of pipes is just a suggestion to save time; each of the functions can be applied separately as well.

We can now filter, for example, a specific study and outcome, and inspect the effect sizes:

```{r }
# # Show primary outcome of 'Hauksson, 2017'
# inpatients %>% 
#   checkDataFormat() %>% 
#   expandMultiarmTrials() %>% 
#   calculateEffectSizes() %>% 
#   dplyr::filter(study.id == "Hauksson, 2017" & primary==1) %>% 
#   dplyr::select(study, es, se, condition, 
#                 multiple_arms, primary)
```


Inspecting the effect sizes for the primary outcome in Hauksson (2017), we see that `expandMultiarmTrials` duplicated the control group row to obtain pairwise comparisons for both intervention arms. 

## Pooling effect sizes

After the effect sizes have been calculated using `calculateEffectSizes`, the data set can be used for meta-analyses. We simply have to add a new step to the pipe, in which the generated variables `es` (the effect size) and `se` (the standard error) are used for pooling. One option is to use the `metagen` function in the `meta` package to pool the effects. 

In the example below, only the **primary outcome** data is pooled. This is achieved by including `primary == 1` into the the call to `dplyr::filter`. Other types of meta-analyses can be conducted by changing the filtering logic in this step (e.g. adding ` & country == 4` to only use studies from a specific location).

```{r, message=F, eval=F}
# library(meta)
# 
# inpatients %>% 
#   checkDataFormat %>% 
#   expandMultiarmTrials %>% 
#   calculateEffectSizes %>% 
#   dplyr::filter(!is.na(es) & primary==1) %>% 
#   meta::metagen(es, se, studl = study, comb.f = FALSE, data=.)
```

As we can see, the functions of the `metapsyTools` package, combined with the pipe operator, allow to (1) check and transform the data, (2) calculate the effect sizes, and (3) pool selected comparisons, using just 6 lines of code.

Three-level meta-analyses can also be conducted using this logic:

```{r, message=F, eval=F}
# library(metafor)
# 
# inpatients %>%
#   checkDataFormat ()%>%
#   expandMultiarmTrials() %>%
#   calculateEffectSizes() %>%
#   dplyr::filter(!is.na(es)) %>%
#   dplyr::mutate(es.id = 1:nrow(.)) %>%
#   metafor::rma.mv(es, se^2, data = ., slab = study.id,
#                   random = ~ 1 | study.id/es.id, test = "t")
```
